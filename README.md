# LeetCode Solutions
In this repository, I'll be archiving of all the various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) solutions I came up with and improved upon throughout my grind since I'm running out of space in my OneNote. All problems will be labeled and organized according to difficulty along with my own notes on them. 

I'll be slowly migrating all the current solutions I have saved, so stay tuned B)

## Languages Used:
* Python (Primary language)
* C++ (tryna learn)
* Java

## How Do You Pick What Questions To Do?
I literally just do the daily problem if I feel like it, plus previous weekly/biweekly contest questions if I'm feeling spicy.

## Problem Solving Process
1. Take 5 minutes to formulate a plan based on constraints + topic
2. Implement plan, or simply try to brute force if I can't think of anything
3. Look at related topics to see what approaches should be used, and watch videos and/or learn about the topics in the context of this question
4. Ask friends on how my idea sounds/how they'd approach it
5. If I still can't get it, give up on it for a few days/weeks until I want to try again
6. Look at the discussions for ideas on how to approach the problem
