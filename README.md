# LeetCode Solutions
In this repository, I'll be keeping track of all the various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) solutions I came up with and improved upon throughout my grind. My profile can be accessed [here](https://leetcode.com/oscarla5747/). All problems will be labeled and organized according to difficulty along with my own notes on them. Disclaimer that I initailly started with Java, and migrated to Python as I progressed so some solutions will feature one, the other, or both.

I'll be slowly migrating all the current solutions I have, so stay tuned B)

## Problem Solving Process
1. Take 5 minutes to formulate a plan based on constraints + topic
2. Implement plan, or simply try to brute force if I can't think of anything
3. Look at related topics to see what approaches should be used, and watch videos and/or learn about the topics in the context of this question
4. Ask friends on how my idea sounds/how they'd approach it
5. If I still can't get it, give up on it for a few days/weeks until I want to try again
