# [149. Max Points on a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/description/)

Given an array of points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

 

Example 1:

    Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
    Output: 3

Example 2:

    Input: points = [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]
    Output: 4
 

Constraints:

* 1 <= points.length <= 300
* points[i].length == 2
* -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4
* All the points are unique.
