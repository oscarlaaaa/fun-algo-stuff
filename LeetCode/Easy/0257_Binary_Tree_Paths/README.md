# [257. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:

    Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
    Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]

Example 2:

    Input: root = [1]
    Output: ["1"]
 

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
