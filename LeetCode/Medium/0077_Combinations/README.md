Given two integers `n` and `k`, return all possible combinations of `k` numbers out of the range `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

    Input: n = 4, k = 2
    Output:
    [
        [2,4],
        [3,4],
        [2,3],
        [1,2],
        [1,3],
        [1,4],
    ]

Example 2:

    Input: n = 1, k = 1
    Output: [[1]]
 

Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 20
* 1 <= k <= n
