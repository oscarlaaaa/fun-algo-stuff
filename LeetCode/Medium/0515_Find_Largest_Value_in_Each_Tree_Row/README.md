Given the root of a binary tree, return an array of the largest value in each row of the tree (0-indexed).

 

Example 1:

    Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
    Output: [1,3,9]

Example 2:

    Input: root = [1,2,3]
    Output: [1,3]
 

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [0, 10^4].
* -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
